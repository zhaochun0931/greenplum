PostgreSQL manages database access permissions using the concept of roles. A role can be thought of as either a database user, or a group of database users, depending on how the role is set up. 

The concept of roles subsumes the concepts of “users” and “groups”.





CREATE ROLE xxx LOGIN;
CREATE USER yyy;


(CREATE USER is equivalent to CREATE ROLE except that CREATE USER includes LOGIN by default, while CREATE ROLE does not.)






CREATE USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';







SELECT * from pg_roles;
SELECT rolname, rolsuper, rolcreaterole, rolcreatedb, rolcanlogin FROM pg_roles;

SELECT rolname FROM pg_roles WHERE rolcanlogin;

CREATE USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'password';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE gpperfmon TO xman;

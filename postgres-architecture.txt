Before you can do anything, you must initialize a database storage area on disk.

A database cluster is a collection of databases that is managed by a single instance of a running database server. After initialization, a database cluster will contain a database named postgres

Another database created within each cluster during initialization is called template1




In file system terms, a database cluster is a single directory under which all data will be stored.


There is no default, although locations such as /usr/local/pgsql/data or /var/lib/pgsql/data are popular


# initialize a database cluster
To initialize a database cluster, use the command initdb, which is installed with PostgreSQL. The desired file system location of your database cluster is indicated by the -D option, for example:
initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data


Alternatively, you can run initdb via the pg_ctl program like so:
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/pgsql/data initdb



# starting the Database Server
Before anyone can access the database, you must start the database server.

The database server program is called postgres

postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data

postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data >logfile 2>&1 &





default two tablespaces to stores all system data.
- pg_default
- pg_global

Tables form the building block of relational-database storage.

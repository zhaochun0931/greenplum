Before you can do anything, you must initialize a database storage area on disk.

A database cluster is a collection of databases that is managed by a single instance of a running database server. After initialization, a database cluster will contain a database named postgres

Another database created within each cluster during initialization is called template1




In file system terms, a database cluster is a single directory under which all data will be stored.


There is no default, although locations such as /usr/local/pgsql/data or /var/lib/pgsql/data are popular


# initialize a database cluster
To initialize a database cluster, use the command initdb, which is installed with PostgreSQL. The desired file system location of your database cluster is indicated by the -D option, for example:
initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data


Alternatively, you can run initdb via the pg_ctl program like so:
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/pgsql/data initdb



# starting the Database Server
Before anyone can access the database, you must start the database server.

The database server program is called postgres

postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data

postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data >logfile 2>&1 &

base - the actual data directory
It actually contains the real data (that is, tables, indexes, and so on). Inside the base directory, each database will have its own subdirectory



postgres=#  SELECT oid, datname FROM pg_database;
 oid |  datname
-----+-----------
   5 | postgres
   1 | template1
   4 | template0
(3 rows)

postgres=#



In PostgreSQL, each table is related to (at least) one data file.

gemfire=# SELECT relfilenode, relname FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 't_test';
 relfilenode | relname
-------------+---------
       16390 | t_test
(1 row)

gemfire=#










default two tablespaces to stores all system data.
- pg_default
- pg_global



table
Tables form the building block of relational-database storage.

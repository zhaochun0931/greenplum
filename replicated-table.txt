Normally, Greenplum tables are distributed (rows are spread across segments using a distribution key).

A replicated table (also called a replicated distribution) is fully copied to each segment.








create table t1 (id int) distributed replicated;
create table t2 (id int);


insert into t1 select * from generate_series(1,10);
insert into t2 select * from generate_series(1,10);

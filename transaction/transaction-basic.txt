A database transaction is a single unit of work that consists of one or more operations.

A classical example of a transaction is a bank transfer from one account to another. A complete transaction must ensure a balance between the sender and receiver accounts.

This implies that if the sender account transfers X amount, the receiver receives exactly X amount, neither more nor less.

A PostgreSQL transaction is atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable. These properties are often referred to collectively as ACID

Common Default User Schemas

Every database has a default schema named public. If you do not create any schemas, objects are created in the public schema. 







System Schemas (built-in)
These exist in every Greenplum database and should generally not be modified except by administrators:

 gp_toolkit
 information_schema
 pg_aoseg
 pg_bitmapindex
 pg_catalog
 pg_toast

In terms of physical topology, Greenplum database is a typical master segment structure, A Greenplum cluster is usually composed of a Master node, a Standby node and multiple Segment nodes, and the nodes are interconnected through a high-speed network. 


Master is the entrance of the whole database. End users connect to master to perform query. 
Standby master will provide high availability support for master. 
The segment node is a work node, and the data exists on the segment. 
Mirror segment will provide high availability support for segment.



Greenplum database
- master
- standby
- segment(primary segment, mirror segment)
- interconnect




A segment host typically runs from two to eight Greenplum segments, depending on the CPU cores, RAM, storage, network interfaces, and workloads.



Greenplum Database uses Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) for master/standby master mirroring

In terms of physical topology, Greenplum database is a typical master segment structure, A Greenplum cluster is usually composed of a Master node, a Standby node and multiple Segment nodes, and the nodes are interconnected through a high-speed network. 


Master is the entrance of the whole database. End users connect to master to perform query. 
Standby master will provide high availability support for master. 
The segment node is a work node, and the data exists on the segment. 
Mirror segment will provide high availability support for segment.



Greenplum database
- master (primary master, standby master)
- segment (primary segment, mirror segment)
- interconnect




A segment host typically runs from two to eight Greenplum segments, depending on the CPU cores, RAM, storage, network interfaces, and workloads.



Greenplum Database uses Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) for master/standby master mirroring
- walsender
- walreceiver

In PostgreSQL, the walsender is a background process running on the primary server in a replication setup. It is responsible for sending Write-Ahead Log (WAL) data to connected standby servers or other clients that use WAL data for replication or streaming.

In PostgreSQL, the walreceiver is a process responsible for streaming Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) data from the primary server to a standby server in a replication setup.
The walreceiver fetches WAL data from the primary server and writes it to the standby server's WAL segment files. This ensures the standby server remains synchronized with the primary server by replaying the changes described in the WAL.

Write-Ahead Log (WAL)






checkpoints

A checkpoint is a known safe starting point for recovery, since it guarantees that all the previous changes to the database have already been written to disk.







archive

In PostgreSQL, WAL archiving allows you to save the Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) to a specified location so that they can be used for point-in-time recovery (PITR) or replication.



postgresql.conf




archive_mode = always
archive_command = 'cp /data1/pg_wal/%f /tmp/archive/%f'




show archive_mode;
show data_directory;
select pg_switch_wal();

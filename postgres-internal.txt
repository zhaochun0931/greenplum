How Connections Are Established

PostgreSQL implements a “process per user” client/server model. In this model, every client process connects to exactly one backend process.

The backend process parses the query, creates an execution plan, executes the plan, and returns the retrieved rows to the client by transmitting them over the established connection.








The Parser Stage
The parser stage consists of two parts:
- The parser defined in gram.y and scan.l is built using the Unix tools bison and flex.
- The transformation process does modifications and augmentations to the data structures returned by the parser.
